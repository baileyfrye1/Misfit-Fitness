                                I have been training with Stephanie for over 3 years now and it has been a fantastic experience. She always adapts perfectly to my strength level at the time and always is able to craft the perfect workout for me!

                                I started working out with Stephanie somewhat reluctantly only because as a somewhat healthy man, we are generally hesitant to feel like we need a trainer. My wife already trains with her and was really enjoying working out with her and encouraging me to as well. I started a few months ago and have to say I’ve been having a great time and it’s really helped out mixing up my workouts, getting advice from her on how to work around a few nagging injuries I have and she’s just a great person to spend an hour with.

                                Never in a million years would I have thought I would want to pursue a bikini competition. I began to notice how Stephanie was so driven and focused in the gym. She was always challenging herself and pushing her self during every workout and her motivation was so intriguing to me. I have always wanted to compete at some point in my life and seeing her bubbly personality along with her dedication in the gym made me believe that I could do it. Stephanie was prepping for her first show and she asked me if I wanted to do the prep with her and even though I felt I wasn’t necessarily ready she reassured me she would help me through the process. Any type of body building prep is so mentally and physically exhausting. It’s so important to have a coach that will listen to you and care about you all the way around. There was times I would text her randomly saying, “No way I can get on stage, I’m not ready” and she would encourage me everyday to just keep going and TRUST THE PROCESS! She was always on top of my week by week schedule of workouts on her app and was willingly to work with my crazy schedule, and she was just a text away if I needed her. We bonded over pickles, low carb ideas, ninja creami recipes, and our hatred for sprints. Stephanie helped me do something that I thought wasn’t achievable for me personally all while she was prepping for a show herself. Stephanie is an incredible coach and I never would have gotten through this prep without her. Not only am I incredibly proud of myself but I am even more proud of what she accomplished on show day, and more importantly the wonderful friendship that has came out of this entire thing.

                                I have trained with Stephanie for over three years. I consider it to be one of the best things I have done for myself. 
                                The exercise routines she prepares have helped me gain strength I use in all areas of my daily life. 
                                During knee replacements and a broken wrist, she worked to find modifications to keep my exercise routine going. 
                                Stephanie is very positive and encourages me to keep working out. I love training with her.
